# Conway-sGameOfLife
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life. A simple zero player game / thought experiment. Relies only on begining input.

Made this over the summer realized I didn't have it up here :). Right now it is working fully but could definetly use some polishing. Hit Enter to iterate one step, hold to go a bit faster.
